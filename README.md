# MIS-64060
Repository dedicated to coursework and projects for MIS-64060: Fundamentals of Machine Learning.

Assignment 1:

This assignment focused on familiarizing the class with the functionality and use of R and GitHub. The objectives included downloaded/importing a file, doing general descriptive statistics, and simple graphs to review variables in the data. An AirBnb data set for New York City was chosen as the data set for my review.

Assignment 2:

The purpose of this assignment was to further reinforce the topics of KNN classification with a data set related to bank loans. The process of determining the optimal K value was explored, as well as reviewing confusion matrices between data partitions. Additionally, predicitions of specific customer profiles were reviewed.

Assignment 3:

The purpose of this assignment was to utilize the Naive Bayes algorithm to predict if flights from several different airports are likely to be delayed. This involved selecting variables of interest, converting them to factors of different levels, and pre-processing the data for the model. The results were reviewed via AUC values, ROC curves, confusion matrix and related sensitivity and specificity values for the model.
